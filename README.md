## Configuration Interface
The configuration interface is accessible through `http://<host>/setup`. For a locally running instance, it is typically reached by `http://localhost:3000/setup`. The username and password are assigned at the top of `config/config_full.yml`.

Everything in the configuration interface simply creates a new version of `config/config_full.yml`, meaning that all changes can be made directly to the configuration file just as well as through the interface.

After **saving** though the interface, make sure the server is **restarted** (this will happen automatically on any production server using *Passenger*, but not on local instances), and the page manually reloaded. Otherwise the old data will be shown, and any subsequent changes will overwrite the previously made ones.
## Workflows
A workflow defines which steps a job goes through to be processed. A Workflow is built up of [Steps] (#flow-steps), which each points to a specific [Process] (#processes).
### Creating a workflow
Workflows are created through the interface under *Flows*. The button *Create new flow* will create a new flow with a generated name, which can be changed in the next step.
### Workflow name
The workflow name has to be unique, and the preferred convention is to use upper snake-case (e.g. MY_FLOW).
### Workflow parameters
A workflow can have any number of predefined parameters. These parameters get their values from user-input per job. This makes the workflow highly flexible, and reduces the need for having many almost-identical workflows when there are only small differences.

**Parameter options**
**name** (String, lower snake-case e.g. 'my_parameter') - The name of the parameter, decides what it will be called in the GUI, as well as how to call it from a flow step.
**info** (String) - A description, meant to be able to guide the user as to what the parameter means. (e.g. 'Assign the number of pages this job has')
**type** (Predefined input types, i.e. one of 'radio') - The type of input for the user.
**options** (List of values) - The list of values available when using a predefined input type such as 'radio'. The option elements can be assigned as simple strings, or as a Hash object containing the keys **value** and **label**. The label can then be used to explain the value when using a dropdown, for example.

**Example:** Defines one parameter 'processing_station' for the current flow, using a radio input.
```json
"parameters": [
      {
        "name": "processing_station",
        "info": "Which station was used",
        "type": "radio",
        "options": [
          "STATION1",
          "STATION2",
          {
            "value": "STATION3",
            "label": "This will select Station 3 for you"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
```

### Folder paths
The folder paths define which folders the flow can possibly store files in. These folder paths are used for two functions:
1. **Listing files** - When listing files for a given job, DFlow looks through all given folder paths and displays the ones that exist and contains files or folders.
2. **Restarting a job** - When restarting a job, all folders that are defined in folder paths and exist, will be moved from its current location to a subfolder called "RESTARTED". This is to be able to be sure that the job is completely restarted, and no old files remain in the file structure. The RESTARTED folder will have to be emptied manually. **Tha folder paths must be valid DFile Paths**

**Example** - Defines a processing, packaging and store location for a job
```json
{
    "folder_paths": [
        "PROCESSING:/%{job_id}",
        "PACKAGING:/%{package_name}",
        "STORE:/%{package_name}"
    ]
}
```

### Flow steps
The flow steps define the core of the workflow, as nothing would be done without them. Each step has the following options:
**step** (Integer) - The step identifier, must be a number.
**process** (Process - Available values are defined in [Processes] (#processes)) - The name of the process to be run for this step. The process has to be predefined.
**goto_true** (Integer - Another existing step identifier) - Points to which step should be run when this step is finished.
**condition** (Evaluable statement) (Not mandatory) - A condition which has to return **true** for the step to execute, otherwise the step will finish and the next one be started. Example of a condition is "'%{copyright}' == 'true'".
**params** - The parameters available for the given **process**, see documentation on each process.

**Example 1:** A manual flow step which should only run if job is copyrighted, and starts step nr **30** when done:
```json
  {
    "step": 20,
    "process": "CONFIRMATION",
    "description": "Check with copyright owners",
    "condition": "'%{copyright}' == 'true'",
    "goto_true": 30,
    "params": {
      "start": true,
      "manual": true,
      "msg": "Copyright is cleared!"
    }
  }
```
## Processes
A process is a potiential step which can be used in a workflow. These processes can be triggered manually & via API-request, or through the built in Queue Manager.
### Using variables
Variables can be used within FlowStep parameters to be able to access a job's properties, such as its ID, PackageName or PageCount. It can also be used to access flow-specific parameters.

*To access a variable, use the following syntax:*
```
%{variable_name}
```
*When using the variable 'job_id' within a parameter, it could look like this:*
```
..
source_folder_path: PROCESSING:/%{job_id}
..
```
*When accessing a flow-parameter, the name of the variable is the same as the name of the parameter. Let's say the parameter 'processing_station' is defined, it could be used as follows:*
```
..
source_folder_path: %{processing_station}:/%{job_id}
..
```

#### Predefined variables
Variables are predefined in the code [app/model/flow_step.rb#substitute_parameters] (https://github.com/ub-digit/dFlow/blob/master/app/models/flow_step.rb#L273-L285). This is where new variables should be added if needed.

**job_id** : The job's ID.
**page_count** : The number of pages(images) of the job. Typically assigned using process COLLECT_JOB_METADATA.
**package_name** : The package name of the job, using the ID and a formatting string defined in the configuration file. For example, format 'GUB%07d' for job id '123' gives package name 'GUB0000123'.
**copyright** : Returns a boolean string value of copyright, i.e. 'true' (copyrighted) or 'false' (not copyrighted).
**copyright_protected** : Same as "copyright", but is easier to understand when used in a condition.
**chron_1, chron_2, chron_3** : Returns the metadata values for chronology. Generally used for periodicals.
**ordinality_1, ordinality_2, ordinality_3** : Returns the metadata values for ordinality. Generally used for periodicals.
### Making an API-request
Observe that you will have to define **api-keys** to be able to use the API.
For an external service to be able to control the workflow steps, API-requests can be made. The requests are built using the following format:
`http://dflow-example.com/api/process/<job_id>?step=<step_nr>&status=[start, success, fail, progress]&msg=<String (e.g. progress message, error message)>`

**Example 1:** Finishing flow step **30** for job with id **12345**
`http://dflow-example.com/api/process/12345?step=30&status=success`

**Example 2:** Starting flow step **50** for job with id **12345**
`http://dflow-example.com/api/process/12345?step=50&status=start`

**Example 3:** Reporting progress for flow step **20** for job with mid **12345**
`http://dflow-example.com/api/process/12345?step=50&status=progress&msg='In progress!'`

**Example 4:** Reporting fail for flow step **20** for job with mid **12345**  (Will also place job in **quarantine**)
`http://dflow-example.com/api/process/12345?step=50&status=fail&msg='Process failed!'`

### Triggered processes
A *Triggered* flow step has to be called to be completed, either through interaction with the DFlow interface or via API-request.
*****
#### CONFIRMATION
##### Description
Is meant to be used as a confirmation trigger that the current step is completed. The trigger can either be called by a manual press of a button inside DFlow, or through an API-request form an external service.
##### Parameters
**manual** (true / false) - If true, a confirmation button will be visible inside DFlow.
**msg** (String, e.g. "Operation done!")
##### Expected outcome
This process only finishes the current flow step
##### Examples
**Example 1:** The manual task of reviewing a document needs a place in the workflow. When done, the user klicks a confirmation button in DFlow to move the workflow to the next step in the process.
```json
{
    "step": 60,
    "process": "CONFIRMATION",
    "description": "Review document",
    "goto_true": 70,
    "params": {
      "manual": true,
      "msg": "Document is reviewed!"
    }
  },
```
**Example 2:** The process of creating jpg-files is delegated to an external software. The external software makes an API-request to DFlow to alert the workflow that it is done.
```json
{
    "step": 60,
    "process": "CONFIRMATION",
    "description": "External application: Create JPG files",
    "goto_true": 70,
    "params": {

**manual** (true / false) - Should be set to **true** to get a confirmation button.
**msg** (String, e.g. "Operation done!")
##### Expected outcome
This process only finishes the current flow step.
##### Examples
**Example 1:** The manual task of reviewing a pdf file needs a place in the workflow. When done, the user klicks a confirmation button in DFlow to move the workflow to the next step in the process.
```json
{
    "step": 60,
    "process": "QUALITY_CONTROL",
    "description": "Check quality of PDF file",
    "goto_true": 70,

        "save": true,
        "msg": "Assign done!"
    }
  },
```
### Waiting processes
A *waiting process* works much like a triggered process, in that it's only function is to finish the current flow step and move to the next one. The trigger in this case however, is its **condition**, which can consist of waiting for a **specific file to exist** or a **specific number of files** to exist, for example.
Waiting processes are run by the internal Queue Manager, and shares queue with all other waiting processes in it.
*****
#### WAIT_FOR_FILE
##### Description
Waits for a given file to exist before finishing.
##### Parameters
**file_path** (Path) - Path of file to look for
##### Expected outcome

##### Examples
**Example 1:** An external process has created an XML-file in the job folder, which needs to exist for the workflow to proceed.
```json
{
    "step": 60,
    "process": "WAITFOR_FILE",
    "description": "Check if file1.xml exists in job folder!",
    "goto_true": 70,
    "params": {
      "file_path": "PROCESSING:/%{job_id}/xml/file1.xml"
    }
  },
```
*****
#### WAIT_FOR_FILES
##### Description
Waits until given folder contains the given amount of files of a given type before finishing.
##### Parameters
**folder_path** (Path) - Path of directory in which to look for files
**filetype** (File extension, e.g. tif, jpg, xml) - Extension of files to look for
**count** (Number) - Number of files to look for
##### Expected outcome
The process keeps repeating until the given number of files are found. If more files than expected
are found, the job is put into quarantine.
##### Examples
**Example 1:** An external process creates jpg files, and the workflow must wait until all files are created before proceeding.
*****
```json
{
    "step": 60,
    "process": "WAITFOR_FILES",
    "description": "Check if all jpg files have been created",
    "goto_true": 70,
